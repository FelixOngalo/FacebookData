)

  # Data preprocessing and analysis
  # You can analyze the data using various R functions and libraries, such as dplyr and ggplot2.
  # For example, you can create plots, calculate engagement metrics, or perform sentiment analysis.
  
  # Sample analysis:
  # Calculate the number of likes on each post
  likes <- sapply(fb_data$data, function(post) post$likes$count)
  # Calculate the average number of likes
  avg_likes <- mean(likes)
  cat("Average likes per post:", avg_likes)
} else {
  cat("Error in the API request:", http_status(response)$status_reason)
}

# Perform further analysis and visualization of the Facebook data as needed.
